A simple tool to find new and hidden music and add it to a [YouTube playlist](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRDuNIkwpnsfJaOX5Bq3jrPtP2WfP_vBl)!

Matt.fm uses the following reddit sources to find music, although they are handily combined into a [Multireddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/lv_insane_vl/m/music/), which has an even wider collection of music.
